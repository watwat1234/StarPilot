  #  - holds both arms at saturation (±LCA_AUTH_MAX) when no driver torque
  #  - on driver override, collapses both arms symmetrically at COLLAPSE_RATE
  #    until envelope reaches ~±LCA_AUTH_SPLIT, then splits asymmetrically:
  #    the arm matching driver direction (yielding) settles at ±PLATEAU_YIELD,
  #    the counter arm holds at ±PLATEAU_COUNTER (yield is shallower than counter)

  # NOT indicate override intent — don't use it for envelope triggering).
  # Hysteresis: enter override at ENTER, exit at EXIT (< ENTER) to prevent the
  # envelope flapping between collapse and rebuild when driver torque hovers

  # needing to sustain force just to feel that the system noticed them — helps
  # with hand-fatigue / RSI.
  # Rising edge detected via per-frame derivative; the brief-yield window does
  # NOT re-arm while still active, so a steady elevated torque only triggers
  # one yield and then the envelope rebuilds.
  # Cooldown: light_collapse only fires when real_override has been off for
  # LIGHT_COOLDOWN_FRAMES — suppresses repeated firings during active
  # co-steering (lane changes), where |drv| oscillates and would otherwise
  # re-arm the haptic-ack window each time, causing felt ripple.

  # drv_mag_filt is a low-pass of |drv| (alpha=0.04, ~250 ms time constant) —
