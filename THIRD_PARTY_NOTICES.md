## Applicable upstream license notices

The upstream repositories and branches identified above publish both `LICENSE` and `LICENSE.md`.
Their READMEs point to `LICENSE` for openpilot licensing, while some extension files point to
`LICENSE.md`. Because the scope of those two notices is not unambiguous, StarPilot preserves both
and treats the more restrictive notice conservatively for upstream-derived material. This is a
record of the published notices, not a legal conclusion about their scope.

### Upstream extension file notice

Several upstream Ford and HKG extension files carry this file-level notice:

> Copyright (c) 2021-, Haibin Wen, sunnypilot, and a number of other contributors.
>
> This file is part of sunnypilot and is licensed under the MIT License.
> See the LICENSE.md file in the root directory for more details.

StarPilot's Ford and HKG integrations were informed by extension files carrying this notice. The
reference to “MIT License” conflicts with the nonstandard restrictions in the referenced upstream
`LICENSE.md`; both texts are retained here rather than silently choosing between them.

For commercial, for-profit, or closed-source use, consult the upstream notice and obtain any
permission it requires. The upstream repository's simultaneous publication of two differently
scoped notices should be clarified with the relevant copyright holders before relying on one to
the exclusion of the other.
