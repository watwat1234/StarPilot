# speed. This lead probes the plan at a constant-TIME distance instead and max-mag
# blends into the command, so initiation can start while still rolling at 9-12 mph.
# The engagement fade (authority ramps to zero as measured curvature approaches the
# lead) limits it to the initiation phase: once the car is tracking the arc, the model
# owns the turn shape — without it, the blend re-creates the 2026-07-16 rolling-turn
# front-load (stickyright2 entry: 0.084 commanded vs the model's own 0.041 spiral). A

# wheel unwinds below the threshold, the lead re-fires — a 5 Hz demand sawtooth felt
