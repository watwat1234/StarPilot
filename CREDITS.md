# Credits and Code Provenance

StarPilot stands on work by comma.ai, FrogPilot, and many other open-source contributors. This
document records provenance that is not adequately represented by StarPilot's historical commit
authorship. It is not an assertion that an upstream contributor endorses, maintains, or is
responsible for StarPilot's adaptation.

## Ford support adapted from BluePilot

StarPilot commit [`3f6ccd104e826643887930b41ad3b4086b833d32`](https://github.com/firestar5683/StarPilot/commit/3f6ccd104e826643887930b41ad3b4086b833d32)
introduced a substantial adaptation of Ford work from BluePilot's `bp-7.0` branch. That commit's
message thanked the project, but it did not record a source revision or preserve the upstream
authors in the code. This file corrects that provenance gap without rewriting published history.

The exact checkout used for the original port was not recorded and therefore cannot now be proven.
At the time of the import,
[`3a838bba6d3d280592c2fd0496b3378977ae25f1`](https://github.com/BluePilotDev/bluepilot/commit/3a838bba6d3d280592c2fd0496b3378977ae25f1),
was the tip of the public `bp-7.0` line. Some imported platform lines instead trace to the
contemporaneous development line at
[`59e3f2f16a38ff0c16d173b0ccddded23aaa1cd8`](https://github.com/BluePilotDev/bluepilot/commit/59e3f2f16a38ff0c16d173b0ccddded23aaa1cd8).
Those histories were merged the next day as
[`e1d051d7ba270261b4455068bd68f1a58db15a4a`](https://github.com/BluePilotDev/bluepilot/commit/e1d051d7ba270261b4455068bd68f1a58db15a4a),
which is the complete `bp-7.0` snapshot used for this audit. This reconstruction is deliberately
recorded as a range rather than pretending that the missing original source SHA can be recovered.

BluePilot repository and its Git history remain the authoritative record and may identify further
contributors.

### Local-to-upstream map

| StarPilot area | Upstream lineage | What StarPilot changed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `starpilot/car/ford/lateral.py` | `human_turn.py`, `lateral_curv_ext.py`, and `values_ext.py` at the reference snapshot above; earlier StarPilot revisions also adapted `lateral_angle_ext.py` | Consolidated the runtime implementation on the extended-curvature strategy, integrated StarPilot Params, and added live-delay curvature lookahead and local tuning behavior. |
| `starpilot/car/ford/fordcan.py` | `fordcan_ext.py` and the extended-lateral protocol, especially `8f8d6d15f` | Reduced the extension to the curvature CAN constructors used by StarPilot and adapted it to the local controller interface. |
| `opendbc_repo/opendbc/car/ford/` | Ford controller/state/interface/radar/platform changes in the `bp-7.0` snapshot | Integrated the changes directly into StarPilot's opendbc layout instead of retaining sunnypilot mixins; subsequent fixes and behavior differ by file. |
| `opendbc_repo/opendbc/safety/modes/ford.h` and Ford safety tests | BluePilot panda enforcement for four-signal curvature and angle-primary control, especially `8f8d6d15f`, plus shadow-curvature work | Retained the extended-curvature checks, removed runtime path-angle selection, and continued adding local regression coverage. |
| Ford Params and settings surfaces | BluePilot's curvature tuning concepts | Renamed and implemented in StarPilot's native Params/Galaxy architecture; no BluePilot or sunnypilot UI classes were retained. |

The local code has materially diverged, but the first four rows remain derivative in design and in
parts of their implementation. Future ports should cite the exact upstream commit in the importing
commit and at the relevant source boundary; when history can be retained cleanly, use a merge,
subtree, or cherry-pick with origin metadata rather than a single squashed attribution.

## Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis support adapted from sunnypilot

Portions of StarPilot's HKG angle steering, CAN integration, panda safety enforcement, safety tests,
firmware fingerprints, and cruise-button management are adapted from sunnypilot. Some upstream HKG
authorship is retained in StarPilot's Git history, and StarPilot commit
[`e33305151`](https://github.com/firestar5683/StarPilot/commit/e33305151ba852ea3350aa9f7a12d1c8bd137c43)
identified its ICBM/CSLC work as a sunnypilot port. Other substantial imports were committed locally
without recording an exact source revision, so this section documents the reconstructed lineage.

The exact checkout used for each historical import cannot now be proven. The reference snapshots
used for this audit are:

- [`sunnypilot/sunnypilot` `hkg-angle-steering-2025`](https://github.com/sunnypilot/sunnypilot/tree/hkg-angle-steering-2025)
  at [`cfb38312d`](https://github.com/sunnypilot/sunnypilot/commit/cfb38312db33779f4727c983d372474a56ccb5d8),
  whose opendbc submodule points to the next snapshot.
- [`sunnypilot/opendbc` `hkg-angle-steering-2025`](https://github.com/sunnypilot/opendbc/tree/hkg-angle-steering-2025)
  at [`cc4b08625`](https://github.com/sunnypilot/opendbc/commit/cc4b08625a98e94b318cab15e45e05dad58042bd).
- [`sunnypilot/opendbc` `master`](https://github.com/sunnypilot/opendbc)
  at [`f95f996f5`](https://github.com/sunnypilot/opendbc/commit/f95f996f5917dcbbf2e32fe51b606a24cf836af6),
  used to audit later HKG fingerprints and extension history.

### Upstream authors and work

  angle integration and signals, non-SCC platform support, and Intelligent Cruise Button Management.

- **Nicholas Evans, dany7915, janpoo6427, Tinkerpet, royjr, Taylor Hoshino, Intelli, Joshua Mack,
  Mark McCallister, Discountchubbs, and other sunnypilot contributors** supplied vehicle ports,
  fingerprints, firmware data, safety-limit updates, and related integration represented in the
  adapted HKG support.

This list identifies contributors found during the repository, commit, and blame audit. The
sunnypilot repositories and their Git histories remain the authoritative record and may identify
additional contributors.

### Local-to-upstream map

| StarPilot area | Upstream lineage | What StarPilot changed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `opendbc_repo/opendbc/car/hyundai/carcontroller.py` | Angle controller and driver-override work in `sunnypilot/opendbc` `hkg-angle-steering-2025` | Integrated the controller into StarPilot's opendbc layout and added substantial local longitudinal, smoothing, recovery, and platform behavior. |
| `opendbc_repo/opendbc/car/hyundai/hyundaicanfd.py`, `interface.py`, and `values.py` | Angle commands, signal selection, safety flags, limits, and platform integration from the angle branch | Combined later upstream changes with StarPilot flags, Params, platform tuning, and local CAN/CAN-FD behavior. |
| `opendbc_repo/opendbc/safety/modes/hyundai_canfd.h` and its tests | Angle-command safety enforcement and regression tests from the angle branch | Extended and reorganized the safety mode and tests for StarPilot's current supported modes. |
| `opendbc_repo/opendbc/car/hyundai/fingerprints.py` and HKG platform data | sunnypilot HKG extension/fingerprint history on `master` plus angle-branch vehicle ports | Flattened extension data into the local opendbc tree and continued adding and updating platforms. |
| HKG cruise-button management and settings integration | sunnypilot ICBM/CSLC concepts and implementation history, including `862828ad6` and `2277e3d49` | Adapted the feature to StarPilot/FrogPilot controls and settings; later revisions changed or removed portions of the original integration. |

The current implementation is not a wholesale copy of either reference snapshot and has diverged
substantially. Its HKG angle-control and supporting safety architecture nevertheless remain
derivative in design and in identifiable portions of the implementation. The applicable upstream
notices are preserved in [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).

## Policy for future third-party ports

Before publishing a third-party port:

1. Read every repository-level and file-level license that may cover the source. Stop and ask the
   rightsholder when the terms or their scope conflict.
2. Record the repository URL, exact commit SHA, source paths/symbols, authors found in the relevant
   history, and the local destination in the importing commit and this file.
3. Preserve required copyright and license notices verbatim. Reorganization, translation, and
   AI-assisted rewriting do not remove source provenance.
4. Retain authorship/history with a merge, subtree, or `cherry-pick -x` when practical. For a true
   adaptation, keep the local adapter as commit author and use an `Adapted-from:` trailer and source
   comments; do not add `Co-authored-by:` for a person without their agreement.
5. Describe material local deviations and make clear that upstream contributors do not support or
   endorse the downstream version.

See [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) for licensing notices.
